\begin{abstract}
\normalsize During the deployment at Wylfa between 2014 -- 2016 a prototype anti-neutrino detector took cosmic muon data in accidental coincidence with the anti-neutrino measurements. From 2016 -- 2018 the same detector took data at the University of Liverpool. By taking the ratio of these two data sets and using Geant4 simulations it is possible to discern specific buildings, building heights, and features at the Wylfa reactor site including the reactor core/reactor core apparatus.\\

\section{Wylfa Reactor Site} \label{sec:wylfaReactorSite}
During July of 2014 the VIDARR prototype detector started taking data at the Wylfa reactor site. A cut away of the Wylfa reactor building can be seen in figure \ref{fig:WylfaCutAway}. In figure \ref{fig:WylfaCutAway} the structure of the main reactor building is significantly denser in the bottom half of construction than the top half. The upper storage section therefore will block fewer cosmic $\mu$ than bottom section with the reactor. This structure impacts the outline of the shadow as the main reactor building does have less of an effect than some of the service buildings that are closer to the detector. This means that measuring the main reactor building height is more difficult than measuring the height of the service buildings closer to the detector. The position of the detector can be seen from google maps in figure \ref{fig:googleMapsDetector}. There are many buildings that will cast shadows on the detector. This combined with the low density of the upper storage section of the Wylfa reactor building means that the shadow analysis is more complex than might be expected.

\end{figure}

\section{Geant4 Geometry} \label{sec:geant4Geometry}
In order to combat the complexity of the reactor site Geant4 is used to simulate each building individually. The overall setup for the buildings in Geant4 can be seen in figures \ref{fig:WylfaSideOnG4} and \ref{fig:WylfaTopDownG4}. Approximations for the sizes in x and y in Geant4 are estimated from the google maps satellite image seen in figure \ref{fig:googleMapsDetector}. The heights of the buildings have to be approximated from the data measured at Wylfa, this is then compared and adjusted until the heights of the shadows roughly match the heights of the shadows at Wylfa. Heights represented in figures \ref{fig:WylfaSideOnG4} and \ref{fig:WylfaTopDownG4} are 25\,m for turbine hall, 45\,m for main reactor building, 45\,m for service towers, 50\,m for back service building, 35\,m for service buildings, 10\,m off the ground for steam bridges with them being 5\,m thick in the z axis.

\section{Reconstruction of Cosmic $\mu$ Tracks} \label{sec:ReconstructionOfCosmicMuTracks}
The cosmic $\mu$ tracks are reconstructed with a custom built tracker. The tracker has two main purposes to run as a continuous online track fitter to allow for constant calibration of the detector (excluding showers) and to perform a full reconstruction of cosmic tracks (including showers). The basic logic chain for fitting each individual track is as follows: 
\begin{description}
  \item[1.] Exclude all hits below 0.345\,MeV
  \item[2.] Exclude hits that are 4 bars away from any other hit 
  \item[3.] Exclude events 4 bars per side that are above a 0.69\,MeV threshold
  \item[4.] Find a basic gradient and intercept using top and bottom hit of the event
  \item[5.] First basic fit of the track 
  \item[6.] Exclude hits that are 4.5 bars away from the track and do second fit 
  \item[7.] Exclude any hits that are 0.5 bars away from the track
  \item[8.] Third and final fit 
\end{description}

\section{Ratios of Measured and Simulated Data Sets} \label{sec:RatiosOfMeasuredAndSimulatedDataSets}
In order to highlight the shadows effectively taking the ratio of two data sets is required. Figure \ref{fig:pvtWylfaAndLiverpool} shows the distortion inherent to analysing the cosmic $\mu$ distribution with the detector both at Liverpool (\ref{subFig:pvtLiverpool}) and at Wylfa (\ref{subFig:pvtWylfa}). This distortion has 3 main components Firstly the cosmic $\mu$ distribution is a spherical distribution which is being analysed by a cubiod shaped detector. Secondly the VIDARR prototype segments were 4\,cm wide by 1\,cm tall by 152\,cm long as a result there is a limit to the angular resolution which causes bin migration. This bin migration is most clearly seen in bins $\phi$ = 0$^\circ$, $\phi$ =  90$^\circ$, $\phi$ = 180$^\circ$, $\phi$ = 270$^\circ$ in both figure \ref{subFig:pvtLiverpool} and figure \ref{subFig:pvtWylfa}. Thirdly there is significant scattering as the cosmic $\mu$ interact with the atmosphere and buildings which causes blurred edges. Therefore the shadows in the wylfa data set in figure \ref{subFig:pvtWylfa} are significantly fainter than would be expected for such large and dense buildings.

\label{fig:pvtWylfaAndLiverpool}
\end{figure}

At the Wylfa reactor site there are several buildings and features that are expected to produce shadows which figure \ref{fig:wylfaTraceOfBuildings} shows with a corresponding key. By simulating each building in Geant4 it is possible to obtain an outline of each building shown in figure \ref{fig:wylfaTraceOfBuildings} as it would be visible to the detector. Then all the buildings can be simulated at once taking the ratio both with and without the buildings highlighting the outline in $\phi$ and $\theta$ as it appears to the detector which figure \ref{fig:simulatedBuildingsThetaPhi} shows. Finally the Wylfa data is then divided by the Liverpool data which is normalised to the number of events in the Wylfa data set this produces the results seen in figure \ref{fig:measuredBuildingsThetaPhi} each component is then visible for each individual building. The simulated 360$^\circ$ panoramic (figure \ref{fig:simulatedBuildingsThetaPhi}) and the measured 360$^\circ$ panoramic (figure \ref{fig:measuredBuildingsThetaPhi}) match each other very closely. Suggesting the shadows shown in figure \ref{fig:measuredBuildingsThetaPhi} are likely an accurate representation of the Wylfa reactor site.
\\\\The feature of most interest is the reactor core which is shown by the thin red line in figure \ref{fig:measuredBuildingsThetaPhi}. This feature is however significantly taller than would be expected it is therefore assumed that the reactor core apparatus is also adding to the shadow as well. The reactor core shielding can also be seen around the core at lower angles of $\theta$ = 20$^\circ$ and $\theta$ = 25$^\circ$ also highlighting the core's position effectively. With the other buildings accounted for in the shadow it is reasonable to assume that this feature is the reactor core.

\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:Conclusion}
The VIDARR prototype has measured the shadows at the Wylfa reactor site and these measurements correspond very well with simulated building positions. These simulated building positions have then helped to inform building heights and specific features at the Wylfa site including the shadow of the reactor core and the reactor core apparatus.
